# Updated TestRunner - Running xUnit Tests Programmatically

The `TestRunner` class has been updated to programmatically run all xUnit tests when the console application is launched.

## What Changed

1. **Added Console App Support**: The project now has `<OutputType>Exe</OutputType>` and `<GenerateProgramFile>false</GenerateProgramFile>` to make it a proper console application.

2. **Programmatic Test Execution**: The TestRunner now uses `dotnet test` command programmatically to run all tests in the project.

3. **Dependency Injection Setup**: The application still sets up the Playwright services and dependency injection before running tests.

4. **Enhanced Logging**: Added detailed logging for test execution, including:
   - Test discovery
   - Individual test results (pass/fail/skip)
   - Final summary with exit codes

## How to Use

### Method 1: Run the Console Application Directly
```bash
cd Sample.Tests
dotnet run
```

### Method 2: Use the VS Code Task
- Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac)
- Type "Tasks: Run Task"
- Select "Run Tests via Console App"

### Method 3: Traditional Test Runner (still works)
```bash
dotnet test
```

## Benefits

- **CI/CD Integration**: Can be easily integrated into build pipelines as a console application
- **Custom Setup**: Allows for custom dependency injection and service setup before running tests
- **Detailed Logging**: Provides more control over test execution logging
- **Exit Codes**: Returns proper exit codes for success/failure scenarios

## Project Structure

The project maintains both capabilities:
- Can run as a console application (`dotnet run`)
- Can run as a test project (`dotnet test`)
- Works with Visual Studio Test Explorer
- Compatible with CI/CD pipelines

## Example Output

When running `dotnet run`, you'll see output like:
```
üé¨ Starting Playwright end-to-end tests programmatically...
üèÉ Running dotnet test on project: D:\path\to\Sample.Tests.csproj
üìÑ Test run for D:\path\to\Sample.Tests.csproj (.NETCore,Version=v9.0)
üìÑ ‚úÖ PASSED: CounterPageTests.CounterPage_ClickButton_IncrementsCounter
‚úÖ All tests passed successfully!
```

This approach gives you the flexibility to run tests both ways while maintaining full compatibility with existing xUnit tooling.
